Test 2:
In order to Test if we can make mazes on the go, we can put down tape and the Robot will follow it. If it does then pass. 
If not then the test fails.

Test 4: We can test if the Robot follows a path based on color by executing the following code. 
Lay down a peice of red tape and a green tape at least 4 inches apart.
Place the Robot at the edge of the green tape and execute the code below.
Then Place the Robot at the end of the red tape and execute the code again.
If the Robot follows the green tape and not the red tape then the test has passed. Otherwise the test failed.

#startcode

from romi import *
import time

def main():
  romi = Robot()
  romi.turnOffInterruptsRGB()
  if(romi.checkGreen())
    romi.goForwardtwo(0)
  romi.stop()
  romi.turnOnInterruptsRGB()
  romi.disableRGB()  
#end main
    
if __name__ == "__main__": main()   

#endcode

Test 5: To test if we can control the Robot remotely, we first need to get the IP address of the raspberry pi. 
We type in the IP address into a web browser and use the interface to move the robot. 
If the robot moves then the test passed otherwise it fails.

Test 6: In order to Test if the robot adjusts for straight movement along a path, then you can run the code provided in Test 4.
If the Robot follows the green path in a straight line then the test passed. otherwise it failed.
