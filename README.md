<h1>Maze Rover Vision Statement</h1>

<p>
For robotics enthusiasts that find enjoyment in watching robots trace through physical mazes, aMAZEbot demonstrates advanced reasoning that leads to faster completion of complex mazes. Unlike other competing robots that only offer remote control usage, the aMAZEbot provides the capability to be fully autonomous, offers remote control usage, maze solving capabilites, a small form factor, a Linux operating system, and the ability to receive additional programming to perform a wide variety of user-defined tasks.
